                Here is some text to go with my great fox images. My daughter loves
                foxes and last summer we had a fox family live in our backyard. Our
                daughter lost her shit. It was amazing to watch them everyday on our
                balcony. One day there was a tree cut down near their burrow, after 
                the tree was cut and the area cleaned up, the foxes had moved on. I 
                hope one day that they return.
