            <h2>Life.. err.. Death comes at you fast.</h2>
            <p>
                One day I was on an errand to claim the life of a giant. When I 
                found him and demanded him to stop, he refused my plea and stuck me down.
                I lay there, on the brink of of my death, worried that the world
                will no longer have someone to claim the lives of the living. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                "If I stay lying here in a corner, no one will die in the world, 
                and it will become so filled with people that they won't have room to 
                stand beside one another."
            </h4>
            <p>
                I was soon surprised to find a young man tapping on my shoulder and 
                asking me if I was ok. He offered me drink from his flask and helped me
                to my feet again.
            </p>
            <h4>
                "Do you know," asked the stranger, as he stood up, "who I am, and whom 
                you have helped onto his legs again?" "No," answered the youth, "I do not 
                know you." "I am Death," he said. "I spare no one, nor can make an exception 
                with you. However, so you may see that I am grateful, I promise you that I will 
                not attack you without warning, but instead will send my messengers to you 
                before I come and take you away."
            </h4>
            <p>
                I watched the man live his life happily, knowing that he was free of me until
                he was notified. He fell gravely ill, however he was stil resolute in his
                safety. He recovered from his sickness and resumed his carefree life, living
                day to day. I came to him one last time... 
            </p>
            <h4>
                "Follow me. The hour of your departure from this world has come."
            </h4>
            <p>
                With his face flush and body trembling, he accused me of breaking my word.
                That I had not sent any messangers ahead of my arrival. I assured him of his
                misunderstanding.
            </p>
            <h4>
                "Have I not sent you one messenger after another? Did not fever come and 
                strike you, and shake you, and throw you down? Has not dizziness numbed your 
                head? Has not gout pinched your limbs? Did your ears not buzz? Did toothache 
                not bite into your cheeks? Did your eyes not darken? And furthermore, has not 
                my own brother Sleep reminded you every night of me? During the night did you 
                not lie there as if you were already dead?"
            </h4>
            <p>
                He stood there speachless. I mean, who could blame him. I motioned with a gentle
                wave and he quitely followed me to his Fate.
